post put delete should be tried out considering the relationships among entities, if not working correctly, change cascade types

exception handling

error responses

security config - authuser (with roles? role field should be added to the related table)

use of bcrypt? - research for other crypt options suitable

maybe frontend can be started with angular later on (as a separate project or addition to this one)



3.11.2023 notes

check for relations - update, delete situations
-book author checked
-librarybranch book checked (deletion of library branch should be checked)
-checkout relations remain,


dto implementations -> libraryuser put, checkout controller, library branch controller and service remain
author->ok
book->ok


filtering -> book,libraryuser,librarybranch,checkout remain
author->ok


after all of these finished, transforming return types to response entity can be done
