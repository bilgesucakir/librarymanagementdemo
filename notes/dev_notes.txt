imp order: (first to last)
author - book - checkout

handling some queries might be added

exception handling

error responses

security config - authuser (with roles? role field should be added to the related table)

use of bcrypt? - research for other crypt options suitable

maybe frontend can be started with angular later on (as a separate project or addition to this one)
