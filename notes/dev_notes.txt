exception handling

error responses

security config - authuser (with roles? role field should be added to the related table)

use of bcrypt? - research for other crypt options suitable

maybe frontend can be started with angular later on (as a separate project or addition to this one)

mapper classes (entity-dto mapping can be moved there, but what about partial update)

after all of these finished, transforming return types to response entity can be done
