***TO DO***
security config - authuser (with roles? role field should be added to the related table)

use of bcrypt? - research for other crypt options suitable

maybe frontend can be started with angular later on (as a separate project or addition to this one)

***NOTES***

to checkouts part, active or returned bool can be added--> returned checkout will be inactive

add bcrypt with jwt or oauth can be used too
