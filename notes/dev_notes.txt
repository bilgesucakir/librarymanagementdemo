exception handling

error responses

security config - authuser (with roles? role field should be added to the related table)

use of bcrypt? - research for other crypt options suitable

maybe frontend can be started with angular later on (as a separate project or addition to this one)

filtering -> book,libraryuser,librarybranch,checkout remain
author->ok
(can be excluded from checkout for now)

mapper classes (entity-dto mapping can be moved there, but what about partial update)

after all of these finished, transforming return types to response entity can be done



book cannot be deleted until checkout is deleted - should delete checkout before deleting the book - cascade.type remove
lu finished, lb


book id cannot be updated with add library branch and update library branch


save edilen luserın checkoutsı empty list mi kontrol et
