***NOTES***
add bcrypt with jwt or oauth can be used too
security config - authuser (with roles? role field should be added to the related table)
use of bcrypt? - research for other crypt options suitable
maybe frontend can be started with angular later on (as a separate project or addition to this one)

test validation changes
